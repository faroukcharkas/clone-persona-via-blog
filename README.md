# Clone Persona Via Blog
This project was created by Farouk Charkas, as a 24-hr rudimentary attempt to recreate a very basic version of Delphi's AI cloning mechanism.

## Technologies Used
* Brev.dev GPUs for computation
* LLaMA model for language processing
* Langchain for embedding
* Feedparser for RSS scraping
* BeautifulSoup for data cleaning
* Chroma as the vector database
* RetrievalQA for the RAG implementation

## Successes
* Able to read, split, store, and retreieve from the persona's blog
* Demonstrates a simple understanding

## Weaknesses
* Unable to convince AI to take on the personality of the persona. The first prompt it did, but the second prompt it didn't.
